As part of Web Design & Client Side Scripting module at NCI, I completed the following project. 

You have been contracted to design the order page for a pizza companies new website. When ordering online, the customer should provide:

Username and password (password must be 7 characters in length)
The size of the pizza they would like: Large, Extra-Large, Supersize (drop down list)
The number of pizza’s they want (must be numeric)
Discount Code  (extracheese)

Stipulations:
Provide appropriate error messages for validation.	
For health and safety reasons, the customer should be given a warning if they select ‘Supersize’.
